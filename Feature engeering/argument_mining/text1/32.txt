love it! my wife and i saw this place when we were about to go into beantown. we had been to a creperie in alaska once and decided to try this one out. i had the chipotle chicken and my wife had cordon blue. i had their house blended coffee and she had hot white pear tea from their impressive tea bar. everything was so good we had to get the carmel apple pie crepe for desert. the staff is super friendly and helpful, the food came out fast and delicious. there are only 7 tables, so it's small, but there are a couple of tables outside. the tea was was amazingly good (i'm not a tea person, but tried my wife's and really liked it) the coffee was really good too. if i had to make a critique, we would have liked real plates rather than paper. the tea and coffee come in glass and you get real silverware, so real plates would be nice. other than that, perfect creperie. we will be back.
