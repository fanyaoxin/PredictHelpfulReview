i came here to buy a subway sandwich two times within the last two weeks and a lady by the name of clemmi(black heavy set lady who wears patch on her swollen eye) made my sandwich both times. the 1st time i came here, i forgot to add pepperoni on my sandwich and clemmi got mad and gave me a dirty look and took a deep breath with such a bad attitude(keep in mind she had just closed the lid to the food and was in middle of making my sandwich and it only took her 3seconds to open food cover back up to get out pepperoni because it's on one side and other side of counter top has all the veggies) and paused for 8seconds with attitude before putting pepperoni on sandwich.the 2nd time i came in, the front door was locked and this place is open 24/7 and i had to keep knocking on window to get her attention(she acted like she couldn't see me or hear me knocking at window even though she saw me as i walked to door) so that i can purchase a sandwich. the meat and veggies were very fresh but this time the bread was so stale(i realized it once i got home to eat sandwich) that i had to through away the subway bread and put my own bread on it. because of how rude she is, i wont be back.
