we happened upon ocean one bar and grille walking through the miracle mile shops from our hotel (the elara). we met friends there and loved finding out that not only were the drinks buy one (on an average price of 9.99) and you get two for free, but all food on their lunch menu was 4.99. we ordered several things from the menu, salmon, chicken tacos, french fries and a salad and they were all very good, solid food choices. the menu has something for everyone and it's nice to be able to sit "outside" which is really in the mall and watch everything go by. they have a really nice cocktail menu, i had some sort of hawaiian sunset that was delicious and the ocean one margarita was very good too. everyone in my party enjoyed their drinks very much, and not just because of the price. our server was lovely, we had fun chatting with her and she gave us great service. we would definitely go back on our next visit to las vegas.
