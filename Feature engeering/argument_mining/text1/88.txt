this is the worst chipotle i have ever been to. i ordered online and clearly they don't care if you want extra anything. portion size was awful. i'm not looking for heaping amounts i just want my money's worth, so i ordered again online another time shortly after and the portion size was extremely small again, i said to myself i will never go back again. i really don't know what's up with this location. i live 4 minutes away and if i want chipotle i have to drive all the way to eton on chagrin which is 30+ minutes out the way. they always make my food as ordered without having any attitudes if you ask for extra. these places need to get it together because there are definitely other places to choose from.
