nothing special about the oatmeal. service was decent but felt rushed- which is fine- i get it- we're at an airport....but then when i did want to leave i couldn't get my card run until i stood up to leave. but worst of all: the coffee was horrible! guys, this is a breakfast restraint and you can't make a half way decent cup of strong coffee? i've had water that had more flavor!!
