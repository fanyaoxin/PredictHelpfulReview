service was amazing. place was packed on a saturday afternoon. server was karen i believe. she had the personality of a south mongolian barracuda, knowledgeable and fast backing it up with the heart of indonesian puppy. absolutly amazing. she was very quick on the draw and her description of the menu brought us to the crunch dog for our app. when they say a foot long it's a foot long. thing was huge, i mean i've seen bigger......but big. main course i went for the steak sandwich. steak, lots cheese and eggs sooo good. reminded me of summer nights as a child. running through the grass, so very very happy. nothing can touch me when i'm in my happy place and for today i call my happy place s3.
