this place was awesome!!! went in the swap meet for the first time since we have moved here to check out what it offered (which was very great stuff by the way). little did i know.. not even being that hungry, we would find a phenomenal place to eat! this place needs to open its own restaurant immediately!! i had the steak burrito and it was one of the best i had in town. hands down! i'm a foodie who loves to try new eats everywhere. great service by the man up front. very friendly, efficient and quick. a very reasonable price makes tia's cafe one of the best i've had in vegas for mexican food!
