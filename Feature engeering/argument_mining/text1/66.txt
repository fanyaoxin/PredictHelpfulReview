always good fresh juicy burgers. they are a bit over price, but i'll pay it because they are delicious. i really wish this burger joint had milkshakes, i mean a burger joint needs milkshakes. if you have a peanut allergy like my son, stay away as the fries are cooked in peanut oil and peanuts are in open boxes in the dining area.
