good service. patio is nice. music was too loud. got the bbq guinness wings. suicide was unbearably hot. my mouth was swollen after. it wasn't the best and not the worst. good place to watch sports. the place turns into a club on fridays and saturdays. they also have 1 buck oysters on wednesday and thursdays.
