had dinner at 6:15. there was a very long wait but we made reservations through open table and were seated right away. it is very crowded but not surprised since this was their second weekend open. server was sort of friendly but very rushed. had a beer and it if course was good. appetizer was chicken nachos which was very good and nice portion size. one mistake was appetizer plate was brought out with yellow globs of food on it... very disgusting. daughter ordered fish and chips, which was very good. i ordered stacked chicken enchilada it was good but would have been better if the flavor had not been identical to the nachos. same smoked chicken, same flavor base. talked with manager and he said they used the wrong chicken on the nachos. so overall i would go back. they have growing pains but worth the visit. update: second visit, great service. some food was brought out luke warm. daughters fries were cold and tough, mac and cheese barely warm. pork sliders came out hot and tasted great. daughters pub burger was spot on. update: well they went downhill bad. service was terrible and they were very inattentive. i had the pub burger. onion was raw and the fries came out in one large clump all stuck together. manager was an idiot. kept making excuses and stumbled over his words. place is way too loud. could not hear my daughter talk. will not go back! update: well we went back again, hoping it would be a good visit. service was terrible. i ordered tuscan pizza which came out very undercooked. daughter ordered california roll which came out as calamari. employee made excuses of being understaffed for poor service. manager agreed pizza was not done. took over 45 minutes to get our dinner to us which we could not eat. manager seemed to not care had smirk on his face and kept staring at the floor while i was trying to talk with him. we were idiots for going back.
