they were so crowded you would expect the tacos to be the best you've ever had. instead they were just mediocre. perhaps it's because the place is so busy it's hard to put out a high-quality product with such quick turnover. but even if the quality improved a lot, you still just have a pretty good taco. don't waste your time seeking out this restaurant.
