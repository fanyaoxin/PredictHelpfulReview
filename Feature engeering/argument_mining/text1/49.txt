it's an average place, and dated. it needs updating, and a little stale. i had the tuna melt that wasn't overly impressed. i liked that it was in the menu, but could be more than just tuna and bread. maybe a nice roll? hand cut fries? it was just blah. i also, am not a fan of people smoking out front under the stoop...i guess it's not really their fault. pricing was avg, and in line. one big plus.. bar staff very friendly, and right there with a drink. very nice, and warm. in the end... i'd like to see it get updated, and some identify.
