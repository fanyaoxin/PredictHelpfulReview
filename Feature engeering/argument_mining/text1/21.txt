in town from philly and couldn't wait to try a nearby persian restaurant - not many down south. how lucky was i to be near darbar. the restaurant for a sunday evening at 9 had a number of tables occupied. i was having dinner on my own and i was seated quickly in a wonderful location. the service was exceptional and the food was even better! i knew i wanted lamb for my entree and of course eggplant and yogurt as an appetizer. everything was wonderful and the lamb shank melted in my mouth. chatting with the server after dinner i mentioned that it had been a while since i had found a really good persian restaurant. when i mentioned philadelphia he immediately agreed as his uncle lives there and can't find anything close to darbar. server even mentioned that their other location also has a patio - i have 4 more nights, who knows?!
