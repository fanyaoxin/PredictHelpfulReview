this is our second visit because while the food was mediocre the first time, the service was wonderful. this time it was my daughter's 18th birthday. we were seated in the back corner looking at nothing, but okay, the hostess did not know, but there were plenty of tables in the restaurant. then we had a waitress that majored in condescension. the food was, once again, mediocre and the server was rude. the two stars are for the cheesecake which did not disappoint.
