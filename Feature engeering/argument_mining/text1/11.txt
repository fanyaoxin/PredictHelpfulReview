best place to dine in for menudo, love the pozole as well (only seasonal item). still cannot get over them not offering bread(bolillo) with your menudo, don't know any other place that doesn't have bread but i've learned to get over it a little and just order a flour tortilla. also, if you love a lot of lemon on your menudo i suggest you bring your own small bottle of lemon juice, the wedges they offer are super small and you get very little lemon and a lot of mess from trying to squeeze every last drop. oh, and the salsa that they serve with chips is really hot and sometimes inedable for my taste. other than that, you learn to live with the above in lieu of good mexican food, definitely my second favorite place for authenic dine in mexican food and first favorite for menudo. large menu selection and everything is good. i suggest you come as soon as they open to avoid long waiting times because the dining area is a bit small and cramped. enjoy!
