we came for dinner on a saturday evening and sat at the bar. the beer was good, service was ok, but the food was terrible. i ordered lobster & shrimp "enchiladas", which had practically no filling. it was just a rolled tortilla with a few shrimp and pieces of lobster meat on top. the two people i was with both got burgers, one was charred to the point it was inedible (requested medium well) the other was also over cooked and came with giant chunks of onion even though he ordered it with no onions. our server tried to take care of us by comping some of the meal so that was good but still would not recommend going here for food.
