we came here for my birthday.....nevernind which one. my boyfriend and i both had a beautiful hand crafted cocktail, neither of which, do i remember the name of, but they were both delicious. mine was made with a housemade pineapple syrup! do it! he had one served straight up and with champagne. i stole a sip when he went to bathroom. delicious, but mine was better. the duck i had was cooked to perfection! the presentation was stunning. every delectable and beautiful morsel on that plate had a delicious and esthetic purpose. the bf's hanger steak was just as beautiful. i will be back before the next birthday....
