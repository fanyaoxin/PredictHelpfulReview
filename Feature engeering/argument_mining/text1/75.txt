good food and friendly service. nice atmosphere too. this was my first time visiting this place. based on the yelp reviews, i decided to come and try this new place. it was a saturday night and luckily that i called to make a reservation before. the restaurant was pretty busy with nice crow. the staffs were so friendly, attentive, and polite. my bf and i ordered irish chowder, black groupen, and faroe island salmon. everything was great. my least favorite was probably the irish chowder though. if you have never been this place and do not stay too far away, it is worth to visit this place. you will not be regret!
