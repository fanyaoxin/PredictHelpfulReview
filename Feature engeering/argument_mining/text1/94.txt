this review is only for my pre-shopping sunday drink experience :) i was just about to order a mimosa and the bartender was pouring what looked like a fresh pink-ish juice of some sort then topping with champagne. i asked what it was and she told me white peach juice. i had her make me a drink with the juice and it was delicious. she was very generous with the champagne and i really appreciated that. i hate paying for a drink of mostly juice. my mom and i had a couple of them and took off to do some shopping. i'd love to return to eat the brunch buffet because it looked delicious.
