i did not know that scaddabush rebranded from the old alice fazoolis but they are doing a great job so far! the food and selection provide a good value to the cost. i ordered the "baked carbonara" as i love carbonara.. and i thoroughly enjoyed the flavours..at first the portion didn't look like it would fill me up but it did! it comes with a fried egg on top too. i tried my friends' pasta and also a sandwich and their food was tasty as well. pretty good for a chain restaurant. the stuffed meat ball wasn't as wow as i'd hope for but apparently the cheese is a must order next time. will be making a return visit but probably at a different location as service could have been better.
