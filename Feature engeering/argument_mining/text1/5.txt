i had driven by oreganos for years and always meant to go in. finally i had dinner there! i ordered a pizza with sausage, mushrooms and anchovies. love anchovies! pizza was topped with mozzarella. so cheesy and good! hard to remember a better pizza. great for breakfast the next morning. wonderful server. he was attentive and always had a smile. a very enjoyable evening.
