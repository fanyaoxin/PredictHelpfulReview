ok spot kind of hipster my wife loved the place she orders the moracchan sandwich, i thought it was ok the prices were high 5.75 for small juice and 11.75 for a large i understand it's fresh you have kale etc but the price was crazy my sandwich was ok i ordered a club it had bacon but that was just all that it resembled from an original club sandwich i don't like to complain but i guess i was expecting it to be better.
