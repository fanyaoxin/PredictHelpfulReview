best tacos al pastor. the only problem with this place is the strange organization. there is one line for al pastor. one line for other types of tacos. and another line for others. then a different line to pay. so if you want a taco al pastor, and a carne asada taco, a taco de buche, and pay, you have 4 lines and by the time you pay, your food is cold. thus, i order only al pastor and avoid the other lines.
