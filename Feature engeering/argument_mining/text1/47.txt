it looks like i'm not the only one writing a poor review. almost 20 minutes for all of our drinks to arrive, we had to suggest she put our appetizer order in (cheese curds, they are bomb) then we waited so long for our main course (wings) we had to ask if we could just get them to go. the server mentioned that the food was in the window so she packaged it herself. of course some of the food was cold and part of the order messed up which we did not notice until we were heading out the parking lot running late to get home. this was last sunday, it was busy, but well staffed. we just had a lousy server. the two others i was with love the place, yet it was my first visit. 2 adults, 1 kid, plus 3 drinks was over $100 with the tip. i expected more.
