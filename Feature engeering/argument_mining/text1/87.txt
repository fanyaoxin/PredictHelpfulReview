the wings here are fantastic! they are big, juicy and full of flavor. they have the best hot honey wings and the jerk wings are seasoned perfectly. if you're looking for great wings at a great price, you need to check this joint out. would have given 5 stars if they served cold beer there, but you can't win them all. pizza here is good too, but i'm all about the wings, and these are top notch.
