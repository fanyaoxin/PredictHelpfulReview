location ok. inside ok. food ok. service ok. fatty tuna 2 pieces market price $19. the photos on yelp do not match the place. i wish them luck. nice waiter but inexperienced, shy and not so knowledgeable. also place is called yummy but they have videos on their tv screens advertising kame. it's confusing.
