we went there for lunch and had jerk chicken and pork was really good and the gravy on the rice was great! the food was very tasty and the meat was so moist and the rice was tasty. i liked the multiple options of sides as i don't always love coleslaw. i think lunch time is the best time to go, we went closer to closing time one day and the menu options were more limited as is the be expected (our bad).
