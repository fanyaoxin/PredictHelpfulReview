went in yesterday evening because i was passing by and it looked decent. i got a box with chicken teriyaki, california rolls, gyoza and a couple of other things and i enjoyed them all. the price was excellent for the amount of food they included with the meal. they were very friendly and i would definitely stop again if i was in the area.
