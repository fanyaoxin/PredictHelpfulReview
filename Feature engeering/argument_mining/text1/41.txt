what a fun find! we were out here for the arhaus warehouse and looking for a lunch spot. thanks to other yelp reviewers, we tried this cute little middle eastern (lebanese in this case) spot. my bf is israeli, so he's a tough critic of middle eastern fare; but we were both thrilled with the food here. the falafel was light, tender, and moist in the center; not the dense hockey pucks at most places. the hummus was creamy perfection! i almost always prefer baba, but not here. my bf said the falafel and hummus were the best he's had in the u.s. the chicken shawarma was tender and flavorful. the beef shawarma tasty, if a little dry. i loved it, the bf not so much. the salads were light, fresh, and delicious. we'll be back. and my bf already texted his whole family to recommend it.
