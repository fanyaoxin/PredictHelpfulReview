we went to the strip just to try gaucho because there has been so much hype about the restaurant. i ordered the burger and it definitely did not disappoint. i really like how you wait in line to order before being seated. that really sped up the process. we got our food pretty quickly and it wasn't too crowded until noon. by the time we left, the line wrapped around the side of the building.
