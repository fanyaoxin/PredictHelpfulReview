i ordered a 9" thick cheese pizza. it was probably a frozen crust, which was not a deep dish crust. the fact that it was not deep dish is not the issue, but the fact that the crust was just bad is an issue. the sauce and cheese were nothing special either, and certainly couldn't overcome the less-than-mediocre crust. service was prompt and friendly.
