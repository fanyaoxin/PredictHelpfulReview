omg i've lived across the street from this place and am so upset that i never stopped by. best tacos i've had in town so far.... everything we ordered was great... even my kids (who can be picky) loved it here. this is a hole in the wall place you can't go without trying... you won't be disappointed. handmade tortillas..... and great service
