i usually hit them up a few times a year, when i'm in the area. lunch special traditional gyro and their greek seasoned fries are bomb. i always order extra tzatziki on the side because i like it a lot. my friends like the pomegranate chicken. but i've never had anything other than the traditional gyro because i don't have to.
