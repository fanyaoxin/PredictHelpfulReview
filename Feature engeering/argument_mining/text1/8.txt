as far as service goes, it was ok. as far as good goes i feel the quality fell off since last visited. i brought my gf here to show her how good of a buffet paris had and unfortunately it was not as good as i remembered. quite a few of the food labels were wrong, things that were not changed over from breakfast and i know they had plenty of time to do so (3 hours) the desserts there were not very appetizing. especially the macarons. i don't mind giving this place another try in the future, i hope things improve.
