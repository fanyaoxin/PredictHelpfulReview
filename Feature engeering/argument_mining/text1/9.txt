first off the staff was wonderful so we had a good experience with that. i wish i could remember the name of our server but she was attentive and i ended up giving her a 100% tip because my food order was wrong, it obviously wasn't her fault but she got it fixed and fast without excuse. i'm not one to turn away food but when i order a bean and cheese burrito i expect there to be cheese. haha that being said why i am giving the restaurant a 3 star is because i don't know how you can say your a mexican restaurant but don't have refried beans. my burrito had black beans and cheese and in all fairness she did say it was black beans but i thought i'd give it a try. it was not good, you just can't have a bean and cheese burrito with black beans i mean maybe if it was mixed with other beans too? i don't know. also how is it that there is not a spicy hot salsa! we asked for a spicier hot salsa than what was given and it was weird, not only was it not hot and spicy at all but it also had a weird fruity flavor. we were excited to test out the new restaurant but it didn't hold up to our standards of what mexican food should be, but it had a good atmosphere.
