we come here for special occasions, as well as just to have an excellent meal. the co-owner katie is always glad to see us, which makes us feel special. we have been dining at beckett's table since it first opened, and we will continue to do so. the restaurant space is warm and inviting with a wonderful energy of diners and staff. whether you sit inside or outside the ambiance is always great. and the food and drinks are spot on! this last meal we arrived without a reservation but were accommodated right away, which was a wonderful surprise, to which we were very grateful. one of our friends has a food alergy, and the staff was sure to accommodate his needs with menu choices. we will be continuing to dine here!
