this place is very inconsistent. ordered here a couple times before and the sandwiches were good, but this time it was terrible. i always order the same thing so i know that they've made it better before. bread was dry. barely any cheese, steak and peppers. i've had subway that's been better. paid 20 bucks for meh.
