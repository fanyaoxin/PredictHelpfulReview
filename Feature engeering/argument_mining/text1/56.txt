stopped in on a sunday for a casual late lunch and a first time visit. i decided to order the 1/2 turkey wrap, soup combo. veggies were fresh and the tortilla was soft but the turkey portion seemed to be very meek. the chicken and rice soup hit the spot. my partner in crime ordered the daily special (egg salad) on marbled rye. she was surprised that they cut the bread slices by hand to order and that the bread was so thick and tasty. she said the egg salad was delicious and was only able to finish half of her sandwich it was so big. we were inspired to try heidi's again and hope to order hot deli sandwich, cajun crab cake sandwich and a smoothie next visit.
