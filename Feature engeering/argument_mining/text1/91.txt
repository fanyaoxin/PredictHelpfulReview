i suppose like many of the large chain restaurants, it is a hit or miss. today, this ihop was a miss. this was mine and my wife's experience at this place. after we were seated at the table, my wife noticed that the silverware was not very clean, they had spots all over them, we had to wipe them down with our napkins. my wife ordered the "build -it" yourself frenchtoast combo. she ordered the eggs, hash browns, and bacon. i ordered eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, sausage, and pancakes. both my wife's and my hashbrowns and bacon was horrible. the bacon was not crispy at all. it seemed that they were soaked in greese for a very long time. the hashbrowns where over cooked and hard, they tasted like they were several days old. my pancakes were undercooked, very doughie. my wife asked for a glass of water. when she finally brought it to our table, it looked like there was lipstick all over the glass. we expressed our disappointment to the waitress about our food, and our dirty dishes. her excuse was that it was very busy. does this mean that because the restaurant is busy, the silverware and dished does not need to be clean, and the food does not need to be properly cooked? i don't think so! however, to give credit to our waitress, she did take my wife's meal off our check after we made our complaint.
