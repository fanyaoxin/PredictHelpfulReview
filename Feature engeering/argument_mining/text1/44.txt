absolutely love this place and would highly recommend! the service is great and it never is that packed, so it's never too loud. the atmosphere is great! i always come here for lunch when i'm in the area as their lunch combos are amazing! the main dish comes with a side of tom yum soup and a springroll. the tom yum soup is one of the best that i've ever had. the price is also very reasonable! i usually get the pad thai with chicken as that is my favourite thai dish. however, the green curry chicken and cashew chicken are also very delicious! overall, one of my favourite thai places in toronto.
