this place has some ups and some downs. i love the location in the summer and my preference is to come for a beer and sit in one of those muskoka chairs on the patio and watch the action on the lake. the food is alright, nothing to write home about. the service tends to leave a lot to be desired - slow to greet/take order, forgetting cutlery, never bringing napkins, not knowing the menu availability well (2 different servers mistakenly told me there were no oysters while i could see other tables getting oysters - i did get mine in the end and they were ok). this isn't a horrible place by any means, but there's nothing impressive about it.
